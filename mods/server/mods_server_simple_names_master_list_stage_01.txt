So if you have deleted creatures manually then add this mod and when the server next starts it will go through the database and try to remove any data that is usually removed when creatures are removed properly. Afterwards you can just remove the mod, it only needs to run 1 time after you did manual deletions, of course if you manually delete again then just add mod again."

modname    DigLikeMiningMod
modname    DigLikeMiningMod                                    *Enabled dredging to ship. Added the ability to use dirt or sand piled on the tile you're standing on if you need to use dirt/sand when flattening or leveling. You will use dirt in your inventory, then dirt in a pile, then sand in your inventory, and finally sand in a pile, in that order.
