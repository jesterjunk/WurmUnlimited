- knives nerfed to not be viable as weapons currently
- crit is generally higher, we'll see how that works lol
- wyvernmods weapons arent a thing yet, might we one day if we figure out how to use them in armoury mod
- Armors have WO stats except drake hide has less casting penalty
All the stats for nerds:

Naeadit

Currently installed mods, some of them require client side modloader: https://github.com/ago1024/WurmClientModLauncher/releases/tag/v0.15
AddKingdomItems - allows for crafting of PMK wagons and such
Altars - new, fancy altars (requires client side serverpacks mod - part of Ago's modloader)
Archeotweaks - better archaeology finds, including rift materials.
AshProduce - forges, ovens and such constantly produce ash. Ash quality = burner quality
BagOfHolding - spell for all priests. Magically increases capacity of containers.
BetterDig - dug resource is put in in crates in vehicle. Also allows for some actions to be preformed from a vehicle which normally require to disembark.
BetterFarm - crops don't rot. Area of Effect farming (3x3 at 50 skill, 5x5 at 70 skill and 7x7 at 90 skill). Adds "pick all" and "plant all" options to planter racks.
BountyMod - money for killing mobs.
BulkSeparated - bulk containers split stacks by quality. Option under right click menu to disable sorting if needed.
Combiner - Allows to combine logs, acorns, cochineal and woad
CreatureAgeMod - new born animals grow up to "hitchable" stage super fast.
CropMod - adds 5 units to every field harvested.
DisableFogSpiders - Removes fog spiders, those are said to cause lag.
DiscordRealy - 2 way communication between some of the ingame channels and Discord server.
DoubleBulkCapacity - Crates are currently set to default x5. Bulk containers are set to max.
DUSKombat - no skill loss on death. Player to environment damage set to x1.5
FireBurnTime - Adds exact time left for the fire to go out in heat sources when examined.
Halloween - decorative plus mini-event
HarvestHelper - adds the /seasons command which returns harvest season data for all harvestables in the events window.

HitchLimits - Allows to hitch any mob which can be lead with a rope to carts/wagons. Untamed animals don't unhitch, Too old animals don't unhitch. Hitched creatures become peaceful.
HWPortals - Adds highway portals. Those teleport the player with the vehicle/mount to any other portal within the same highway network. One portal per settlement. Upon teleporting player gets dismounted so make sure your mount is branded. Vehicles don't have that issue since they inherently have permissions built in.
InfinityWideEntry - removes the limit of 3 tiles maximum width of cave entrances.
MarkAndRecall - Adds craftable runes. Ultima Onine style. Those can be marked anywhere where the player is permitted to cast deity spells (so in other player's cities that permission needs to be granted to allow someone to mark a rune there). They don't take damage from use and can be re-marked in new spot if needed.
MightyMattockMod - adds a new tool: Mattock. It allows for terraforming dirt even if there is rock layer underneath.
ModifyGestationPeriod - Adds "decrease Gestation" spell to all priests. This removes 1 day from the pregnancy timer per cast.

MorePottables - Adds Woad, Rift Crystal, Rift Wood and Sift Stone to the list of items which can be grown in pottery planters.
MoveMod - multiple movement speed and slope limit tweaks.
NoBuildLimit - Building limit from Carpentry skill no longer applies. Allows to build as big as your soul desires.
NoMailCost - mailing items is free but bounced mails still cost 1i (rejected or expired after 14 days)
OneTileMining - Allows to surface mine rock corners without having to expose all 4 adjacent tiles to rock.
Pick More Sprouts - 5 sprouts per action if picking 1 tile ad a time. AoE sprout picking produces the vanilla number of sprouts (1 per tree).
SacrificeMod - sacrificing rare/supreme/fantastic items produces a rare/supreme/fantastic strange bone. Currently chance is set to 100%
SimpleConcrete - Adds a recipe for concrete which uses rock shards and clay only.
SpellCraft - Multiple tweaks and addons. Max faith = 300. 10 faith to become priest. Rite favor required greatly reduced. Replenish spell: casted on a container which can hold liquid makes the container automatically refill itself.
SpellMod - Removes delay between prayer gains and limit of daily gains from prayers. Removes priest restrictions. Gives all priests all spells.
Taxidermy - Allows to create dead, standing and animated decorative models of slain monsters. Adds the Taxidermy Kit item to craftable recipes list. Animated model uses 1000 karma to create.
Timed Pay - Gives players 5 karma per minute online.
TimerFix - some of the actions which don't follow the default action timer multiplier are fixed here.
TreasureHunting - adds treasure maps which are randomly given to players then they preform certain actions.
WaxedMod - allows to wax food items to preserver them as decoration.
Windmill - Adds windmill (grinds flour), Sawmill (makes planks/hull planks/shafts and other wooden items), Masonry Mill (makes bricks and slabs). Put material in the mill, right click and select what it should make - profit.
WyvernMods - This is so extensive that i'll try to write it up separately.
